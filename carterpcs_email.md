**Subject:** SlyWriter - Revolutionary Typing Tool for Students & Workers | Seeking Promo Partnership

---

Hey Carter,

Hope you're doing well! I'm reaching out because I've built something that aligns perfectly with your audience and values - a tool that helps level the playing field for students and workers who are struggling with the increasing demands of digital productivity.

## What is SlyWriter?

SlyWriter is a typing automation tool that helps people who:
- Have disabilities affecting their typing speed (carpal tunnel, arthritis, dyslexia)
- Are ESL students competing against native speakers
- Work multiple jobs and need to complete assignments faster
- Face unrealistic productivity expectations from employers

The app simulates human-like typing with customizable speeds, natural pauses, and even realistic typos - making it indistinguishable from real typing.

## Why This Matters (The Leftist Perspective)

**Fighting Digital Inequality:**
- Students from working-class backgrounds often work 20-30 hours while studying
- They're competing against peers who can afford tutors, essay services, and have more time
- Workers face increasingly unrealistic productivity metrics that favor those without physical limitations

**Accessibility as a Right:**
- Many universities/workplaces don't provide adequate accommodations
- This tool helps those with disabilities participate equally
- It's about equity, not advantage

## Our Donation Commitment

We're committed to giving back to the community:

**For every 10 paid subscriptions, we donate one free lifetime license to:**
- Students with documented disabilities
- Low-income students (Pell Grant recipients)
- Workers facing repetitive strain injuries
- Community organizations supporting digital literacy

**Additionally, 10% of profits go to:**
- Electronic Frontier Foundation (digital rights)
- National Federation of the Blind (accessibility advocacy)
- Local mutual aid networks (you can suggest ones you support)

## The Ask

I'd love to offer you and your community:
1. **Free premium access for you** to test and review
2. **50% discount code** for your audience (CARTER50)
3. **Free licenses** for any viewers you identify as needing financial assistance
4. **Donation matching** - for every license your code generates, we'll donate another free one

We're not just another productivity app - we're building a tool for digital equity. Your platform has always championed accessibility and workers' rights, and I think your audience would genuinely benefit from this.

## Quick Demo Points
- Types at customizable speeds (30-200 WPM)
- Natural human-like patterns with pauses and corrections
- Works with any text input (essays, emails, reports)
- Includes AI assistance for content generation
- Overlay window for easy control

Would you be interested in doing a quick video about digital inequality and how tools like this can help level the playing field? Happy to provide any additional info or set up a call to discuss.

Solidarity,
[Your Name]

P.S. - We're also exploring a "pay-it-forward" program where users can contribute to a pool that provides free access to those who need it. Would love your thoughts on making this as community-driven as possible.

**Additional Talking Points for Video:**
- The productivity paradox: How modern work expects inhuman output
- Digital discrimination: How typing speed becomes a barrier
- The right to accommodation in the digital age
- Why accessibility tools shouldn't be gatekept by high prices
- Building mutual aid into software business models

**Stats to Share:**
- 1 in 4 adults have a disability that affects computer use
- RSI affects 1.8 million US workers annually  
- Average student works 20+ hours while studying full-time
- Typing speed requirements exclude many qualified candidates
